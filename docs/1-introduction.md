# Requirements

## Introduction

The goal of this phase within the project is to understand the context and various requirements that are part of our project. This phase is vitally important as it allows us to identify the needs that our website will address in order to provide an optimal experience to its users.

### Problem Description

The issue we aim to address relates to a topic that has become a key concern for the future of our planet: the climate. More specifically, our project will focus on the Emilia-Romagna region. This way, users will be able to monitor the weather situation in our area in real-time, with the ability to filter based on various atmospheric phenomena. Currently, our users need a platform capable of providing them with real-time data while also ensuring a clear and effective display. Moreover, some users may require notifications about specific atmospheric events. In addition to regular users, there may also be admins whose task is to interact with the installed sensors to modify some of their parameters or, in extreme cases, to shut down the sensors.

### Project Objectives

Our project aims to:
* Improve access to data related to various atmospheric phenomena;
* Implement a notification system regarding different weather events;
* Provide real-time access to data visualization;
* Make the site responsive to ensure access across different devices;

### Context and Stakeholders

Our website will primarily be used by the citizens of the Emilia-Romagna region. In addition to residents, the site will also be useful for those transiting or staying temporarily in the area.

### Technologies

Several technologies will be used to develop this website, including:
* **Frontend**: Vue.js, Tailwind
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Redis
* **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose, Atlas  
The website must be accessible and compliant with WCAG standards.
