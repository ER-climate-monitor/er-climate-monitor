# Conclusions

## Goals and Achievements

We are extremely pleased with the overall outcome. We successfully designed a well-defined architecture in which each service is dedicated to a specific domain, ensuring clear boundaries and responsibilities. A key achievement is that all systems are now highly independent, allowing them to operate, evolve, and scale autonomously. Additionally, for each microservice, we introduced the capability to deploy it on Google Cloud Platform, making it accessible not only locally but also externally. This marks a significant step forward in terms of flexibility, scalability, and readiness for production environments.

## Future Works

Now that we have concluded our project, we can make a brief description of future works that can enhance the quality of the system:
1. Introduce SMS notifications, in this way the user will be notified in real time without having our website open in background;
2. Implement a new page that is linked to a specific sensor, in this way we can have better schemas and charts;
3. Add new page that will have the latest atmosferic news;
4. Introduce the ability to visualise multiple charts for a sensor's detections;
5. Add a new page for visualising the history of detections for a single sensor, by doing so we can show enhanced charts and show temporal events in a period.
