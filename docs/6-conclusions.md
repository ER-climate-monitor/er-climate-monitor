# Conclusions

## TODO

We are very happy with the overall result, we were able to create a very well defined architecture, in which every service is responsible for a single domain. Then for each micro-service we have also introduced the opportunity to deploy it on *Google Cloud Platform* and by making it accessible from the outside world and not only locally.


## Future Works

Now that we have concluded our project, we can make a brief description of future works that can enhance the quality of the system:
1. Introduce SMS notifications, in this way the user will be notified in real time without having our website open in background;
2. Implement a new page that is linked to a specific sensor, in this way we can have better schemas and charts;
3. Add new page that will have the latest atmosferic news;
4. Introduce the ability to visualise multiple charts for a sensor's detections;
5. Add a new page for visualising the history of detections for a single sensor, by doing so we can show enhanced charts and show temporal events in a period.
